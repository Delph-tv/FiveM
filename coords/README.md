Public FiveM file I downloaded and recoded to be togglable. Original Code was NOT made by me, all i did was edit it and make the file togglable instead of start/stop resource. 

Install this folder into your "resources" folder on your server and add it to your config "ensure coords" then ingame type /coords to toggle on or off.

- Added functions in code
- Added a local variable for toggle ability
- Added a While loop to code
- Made Code look a bit more neat
- Added other Code to make work (sorry won't disclose everything, go learn something!)
